# BokaneModulo2

## What is it?
This is an app made for an ecoturistic resort. This project was made because it coveres a real necessity and we decided to do it.

[Click here to see the project working](http://www.bokane.life/)

## What does it do?
This app main purpose is to be able to book rooms and activities and also be the main source of information for 
the place. So what it does is reserve and store those reservations on the DB to the be read, edited or deleted. As well 
the model for the activities is able to create, edit, read and delete. 
Each user can have either 'Guest' or 'Admin' role, this because the admin is going to be able to see all the reservations made
through the app and which user did the reservation.

## Landing page
